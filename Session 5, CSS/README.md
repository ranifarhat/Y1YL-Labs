# CSS - Project Worktime!

- Using the new knowledge you have just learned about **CSS**, you will have to think about the design of your website.
* Below you can find a CSS lab, in case you feel like you need to practice it. It is not required.


# CSS - Lab (Not required)

## Objective: 
During this lab, you will be improving on the Online Shop you created in the previous HTML lab using the programming language CSS.
The main point of CSS is to style your website and make it more appealing, and that is our final goal.

## Instructions:  
1. If you don't have one already, create a new file inside your website’s folder and name it “style.css”
2. Open your “home.html” file and add the code below somewhere inside the <head> tag.
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`
  - Note: This will link your CSS document to your HTML document.
3. Now we want to specify an `id` to the header by writing inside the `<h1>` tag the following code:
  - `<h1 id="header">`
  - Note: This will allow us to change the style of the header separately without influencing any other `<h1>` tagged code in your HTML document.
4. Inside the CSS document, Change the header’s position on the screen by using the selector `id` we gave it and the property `text-align` and change the color of the font.
5. After you added some items to your online shop, pick the ones with the lowest prices and show their price with a **special color** that would tell that they are on sale.
  - We will do that by giving the tag that contains the low prices a specific `class` called “sale”.
6. In the CSS document give a unique color to the prices of items on sale using the selector class we gave it above.


## Bonus:
As a bonus, our goal is to improve our simple navigation bar (from previous lab) and turn it into a Horizontal or Vertical Navigation Bar! 
  - *Hint: W3Schools may be very useful*
Improve the About page with the CSS you have learned during this lesson
and look up more ways that suit your liking.



##### Good luck & do your best!
##### Remember to show your wonderful work to your partners and instructors so we can learn from each other.
